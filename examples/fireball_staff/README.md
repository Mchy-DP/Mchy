# Fireball Staff Example
This program adds a fireball staff to the game.  The staff can be obtained by running the command:
```MCDP
/function fireball_staff:generated/public/give_fireball_staff
```
When the Staff is **Right Clicked** it will instantly shoot a fireball in the direction you are looking.  If the fireball hits something it will explode damaging entities but leaving blocks unharmed.
