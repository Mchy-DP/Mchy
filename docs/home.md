# Mchy Documentation

The Mchy documentation is split into 2 section, languages features (which are the core syntax of the language) and libraries (which provide predefined behavior such as `print` or `setblock`).

## Links
  - [Language features](/docs/lang.md)
  - Libraries:
    - [Std](/docs/libs/std.md) - Note: this is the only library that automatically imports
